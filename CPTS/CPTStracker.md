## Notes

- Each room represents a major topic or module within the certification path.
- Each lesson file (`Lesson-01.md`, `Lesson-02.md`, etc.) will contain notes, commands, tools, and reflections on what was learned.
- Track the time spent on each lesson and update the checkbox `[ ]` to `[x]` or add an emoji when a room is completed.
